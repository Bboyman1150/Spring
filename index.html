    <p class="lead">Obi-Wan is actually a master of the low ground, he defeated both Maul and Grievous from the low ground. Obi-Wan told Anakin that he has the high ground so that Anakin would jump higher than the level Obi-Wan was at, which ended in Obi-Wan cutting Anakin's limbs. Therefore Obi-Wan Kenobi is the master of the low ground.</p>
